# FGCU-Tutoring-Training-AI
### Team Members: Zachary Sutton, Mikayla Ries
The project is a desktop application designed to support the training of tutors at Florida Gulf Coast University. 
Leveraging OpenAI's API Assistants, the application fine-tunes the base GPT-3.5-Turbo model to simulate interactions between tutors and tutees. 
It offers three distinct modes: Tutee, Tutor, and Generate Conversation. 
Users can role-play as either a tutee or a tutor, and generate simulated conversations between the two roles. 
The application aims to provide training for both new and experienced tutors, offering practice opportunities and enhancing the overall training process.
Also, this application provides insights into how the application is being used and can evaluate conversations between tutors and tutees in the Data Analysis Dashboard.
